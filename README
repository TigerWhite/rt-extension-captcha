NAME
    RT::Extension::Captcha - solve a CAPTCHA before some actions in RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension is for RT 3.8.1 or newer. At this point solving captchas
    is required when user create a ticket using either regular interface or
    quick create (with 3.8.2 or newer only) and on replies/comments
    (updates).

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    In the RT config:

        Set(@Plugins, 'RT::Extension::Captcha', ... other extensions ... );

CONFIGURATION
  No CAPTCHA rights
    Users who have right 'NoCaptchaOnCreate' or 'NoCaptchaOnUpdate' will see
    no captchas on corresponding actions.

  Font
    As GD's builtin font is kinda small. A ttf font is used instead. By
    default font defined by ChartFont option (RT's option to set fonts for
    charts) is used for CAPTCHA images.

    As well, you can set font for cpatchas only using "%Captcha option"
    described below.

  %Captcha option
    See etc/Captcha_Config.pm for defaults and example. %Captcha option is a
    hash. Now, only ImageProperties key has meaning:

        Set(%Captcha,
            ImageProperties => {
                option => value,
                option => value,
                ...
            },
        );

    ImageProperties are passed into "new" in GD::SecurityImage. Read
    documentation for the module for full list of options.

LICENSE
    Under the same terms as perl itself.
